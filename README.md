# OLX_JARVIS
This is a repository for the code for the OLX JARVIS hackathon held at Shaastra, IIT Madras.

PS - This competition was held in 2019. After that, this repo was made and modified for readability and removing clumsiness. It represents my final submission in the competition.

Out of around 20 teams who participated, this submission was ranked 4th.
